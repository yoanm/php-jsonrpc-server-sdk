# @TODO Investigate: `workflow_run` don't create a status check on the related PR !
# Would it be handy/secure/not to complex to create a reports-group/check-run-from-workflow-run which:
# - Would need to be added as first workflow wtep in order to create a `in-progress` check-run with all info fetched from the triggering workflow
#   - Add a `fails-on-caller-failure` option which would create `failed` check-run and exit with an error ? (a bit more handy than end-user having to check it)
# - Would update the check-run during post-process with the current status of the triggered workflow
